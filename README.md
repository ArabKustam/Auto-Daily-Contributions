## 📝 Overview

**Auto Daily Contributions** is a sophisticated automation tool designed to maintain a consistent and active GitHub contribution graph. It operates autonomously, ensuring your profile remains active 365 days a year.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Graphical Configuration**: User-friendly GUI (`settings_ui.py`) to manage settings.
- **🎲 Intelligent Randomization**: Performs a random number of commits daily (user-defined range) to mimic organic activity.
- **🚀 Fully Autonomous**: Runs via GitHub Actions or local scheduling with auto-termination.
- **🔒 Stealth Mode**: Activity logs are locally scoped and ignored by git to keep the repository clean.
- **☁️ Cloud Native**: Zero local resource usage when deployed to GitHub Actions.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Quick Start (GUI)
1. Run `settings_ui.py` to open the configuration dashboard.
2. Set your desired **Minimum** and **Maximum** daily commits.
3. Click **Save Settings**.
4. The bot will respect these settings for every future run.

### Manual Execution
```bash
python activity_bot.py
```
